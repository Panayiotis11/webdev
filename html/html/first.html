        <h1>Fundamentals of HTML</h1>

        <h2>Text Formatting</h2>

        <p>A paragraph with some words that are emphasized and <strong>some important words.</strong> </em>Followed by some <mark>highlighted words.</mark> Feel free to add any other text formatting that appeals to you</p>

        <pre>
            this is some text
            that is laid out exactly as
            Laid out at code level without any additional
            markup
        </pre>

        <h2>Special Characters</h2>

        <p>The browser thinks < is a programming character. Also >. The browser also ignores any line breaks <br>      
        in your code any  white space. To include these you need to use special characters aka html character entities. There are other entities available such as £ and &</p>

        <h2>Links</h2>
        <p>A web page without any links is a unique and peculiar find. You can have links to seperate sites such as <a href="https://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/">Leeds Beckett.</a> Links to other pages of the <a href="https://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/"></a>same page.</p>

        <h2>Images</h2>
        <p>This image is stored on this server in an image sub-folder <img src="images/box.png" width="100" height="100"></p>
        <p>I hope you added an alt attribute to support screen readers</p>
        <p>Why not check to see what happens if you try to validate your code using the W3C Markup Validation service without the alt attribute included. If you right click on view source you can check your code and see the HTML comment you have added just inside the body tag</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Second Page</h2>
    <p><a href="second.html">Second Page</a></p>
    


  <!--
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li> The final para is automatically word wrapped by the browser and does not contain a line break</li>
        <li>The image has been prepared as small 100x100 image prior to inclusion</li>
        <li>To create a link to another page a simple second page will be needed – put a return link on that page</li> 
        <li>To test the intrapage link you will probably need to resize the browser so that only a narrow vertical window is open.</li>
